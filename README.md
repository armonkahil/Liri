# Liri
#### Node.js Homework

## In this assignment, you will make LIRI. LIRI is like iPhone's SIRI. However, while SIRI is a Speech Interpretation and Recognition Interface, LIRI is a Language Interpretation and Recognition Interface. LIRI will be a command line node app that takes in parameters and gives you back data.


Commands | Description
---------| -----------
concert-this | Source Bands In Town API for event dates.
spotify-this-song | Source Spotify for information about a specific song.
movie-this | Source Omdb API for information about a certain movie. Leave blank for Mr. Nobody.
do-what-it-says | Read random.txt file and complete task in file.

## All data is logged in log.txt
